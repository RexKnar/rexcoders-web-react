      review: `I was looking out for the right place to build my skills in software developing to fulfill my long-standing desire to shift my career from education industry to IT industry. Finally I have found and joined Rexcoders Coding Academy. The way of training given in this academy was very unique. I got excellent learning experience from Rexcoders coding academy. The best parts of trainings I admired and enjoyed in the academy are Individual care to each student, conducting weekly technical Games, weekend technical sessions. It is a Right place to build your carrier towards IT.`

      review: `Rexcoders coding academy has knowledgeable and experienced instructors who can convey complex coding concepts in a way that is easy to understand. It is the place where I developed myself in every aspect. We can develop our skills in many ways, but I developed my skills such as communication, deliverance, and so on here. Individual training is the best part I liked personally.
      Now I have the confidence to develop a Web application.`
